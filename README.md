# Jumble Online

Jumble Online is a small-sized store selling second hand, one-off items. Inspired by declutter expert and organising consultant Marie Kondo, the idea behind Jumble Online is to showcase the second hand items you no longer need and want to sell to others instead of throwing them away. Itâ€™s an online version of a car boot sale, but instead of showing items in your garden or at a stall, people anywhere in the world can buy your unwanted material possessions over the Internet.
